## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Based upon the coefficients calculated using the linear regression [LM Screenshot](deliverable1.png) 3 variables provide a non-random amount of variance.  Those variables are:
 - Vehicle Lenght (strong correlation)
 - Ground Clearance (strong correlation)
 - AWD (strong correlation)

 No the slope of the inear model is not 0.  This is due to the strong correlations mentioned above.

 No.  2 items that should have a strong correlation (spoiler angle and weight) have no correlation to mpg, which is counterintuitive to common sense.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

After performing the analysis and generating the below screenshot [Lot_Summary](deliverable2.png), it is clear that lot 3 does not meet the required manufacturing specification of variance below 100.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
Based on the tests performed the sample mean of the populate is statistically different than the population mean.  [T-Test Sample vs Population](deliverable3.png)
Further testing should be performed to isolate the possible Lots.
